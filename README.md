Script for Google Spreadsheets that will download your Fitbit data

This script will access your Fitbit data via the Fitbit API and insert it into a Google spreadsheet.
The first row of the spreadsheet will be a header row containing data element names.
Subsequent rows will contain data, one day per row.
Note that Fitbit uses metric units (weight, distance) so you may wish to convert them.
